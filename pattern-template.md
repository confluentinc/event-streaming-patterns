# Pattern Name
TODO: Description of the general pattern. Consider explaining situations in which the pattern might be applied.

## Problem
TODO: Short, technology-agnostic English summary of the problem stated as a single "super-punchy" question.

## Solution
TODO: Provide a technology agnostic diagram and supporting text explaining the pattern's implementation (placing the diagram first).

## Implementation
TODO: Technology specific code example, ksqlDB preferred. (Not every pattern will have code)

Use language keyword for code blocks, when possible:

```
```java
```python
```

## Considerations
TODO: Technology specific reflection on implementing the pattern 'in the real world'. Considerations may include optional subsequent decisions or consequences of implementing the pattern.

## References
* TODO: Reference link to the EIP pattern as citation
* TODO: pointers to related patterns?
* TODO: pointers to external material?
