In some situations, it is preferable to separate reads from writes. There are several reasons to do this but the most prevalent is that the application can now save data in the exact form in which it arrives, accurately reflecting what happened in the real world, while reading it in a different form, one that is optimized for reading. For example, a user adding and removing items from their cart would all be recorded as a stream of immutable events: t-shirt added, t-shirt removed, etc. These are then summarized into a separate view that used to serve reads, for example summarizing the various user events to represent the accurate contents of the cart. Problem How can we store and hold data in the exact form in which it arrived but read from a summarized and curated view? Solution Represent changes that happen in the real world as Events - an order is shipped, a ride is accepted, etc. - and retain these events as the system of record. Subsequently, aggregate those Events into a view that summarizes the events to represent the current state, allowing applications to query the current values. So for example, the current balance of an account would be the total of all the payment events that added money to or removed it from the account. The system of record is the stream of payment events. The view we read from would be the account balance. Implementation The streaming database ksqlDB can implement a CQRS using an Event Stream and Table . Event Streams are built into to the streaming database design. Creating a new stream is straightforward: CREATE STREAM purchases (customer VARCHAR, item VARCHAR, qty INT WITH (kafka_topic='purchases-topic', value_format='json', partitions=1); Events can be directly using familiar SQL syntax. INSERT INTO purchases (customer, item, qty) VALUES ('jsmith', 'hats', 1); INSERT INTO purchases (customer, item, qty) VALUES ('jsmith', 'hats', 1); INSERT INTO purchases (customer, item, qty) VALUES ('jsmith', 'pants', 1); INSERT INTO purchases (customer, item, qty) VALUES ('jsmith', 'sweaters', 1); INSERT INTO purchases (customer, item, qty) VALUES ('jsmith', 'pants', 1); INSERT INTO purchases (customer, item, qty) VALUES ('jsmith', 'pants', -1); We can create a Materialized View of the data as a Table : CREATE TABLE customer_purchases WITH (KEY_FORMAT='JSON') AS SELECT customer, item, SUM(qty) as total_qty from purchases GROUP BY customer, item emit changes; And continuously query for changes to the state of the customer_purchases table: SELECT * FROM customer_purchases EMIT CHANGES; Considerations CQRS adds complexity over a traditional simple CRUD database implementation.

In these situations, it may be useful for client applications in one event streaming platform to have access to Events produced in another one. All clients shouldn't be forced to read from the source event streaming platform, which can incur high latency and data egress costs. Instead, with a move-once-read-many approach, the data can be replicated to a local datacenter where clients can do all their processing quickly and cheaply. Problem How can multiple Event Streaming Platforms be connected so that events available in one site are also available on the others? Solution Create a connection between the two Event Streaming Platforms , enabling the destination platform to read from the source one. Ideally this is done in realtime such that as new events are published in the source event streaming platform, they can be immediately copied, byte for byte, to the destination event streaming platform. This allows the client applications in the destination to leverage the same set of data. Implementation Practically, replication is not enabled completely on all data streams, as there are always exceptions, organizational limitations, technical constraints, or other reasons why we wouldn't want to copy absolutely everything. Instead, we can do this on a per topic basis, where we can map a source topic to a destination topic. With Apache Kafka\u00ae, we can do this in one of several ways. Option 1: Cluster Linking Cluster Linking enables easy data sharing between event streaming platforms, mirroring topics across them. Because Cluster Linking uses native replication protocols, client applications can easily failover in the case of a disaster recovery scenario. ccloud kafka link create east-west ... ccloud kafka topic create <destination topic> --link east-west --mirror-topic <source topic> ... Other messaging systems like RabbitMQ, Active MQ, etc., provide similar functionality but without the same levels of parallelism. Option 2: Connect-based Replication Operators can set up such inter-cluster data flows with Confluent's Replicator or Kafka's MirrorMaker (version 2), tools that replicate data between different Kafka environments. Unlike Cluster Linking, these are separate services built upon Kafka Connect, with built-in producers and consumers. Considerations Note that this type of replication between event streaming platforms is asynchronous, which means an event that is recorded in the source may not be immediately available at the destination. There is also synchronous replication across event streaming platforms (e.g. Multi Region Clusters ) but this is often limited to when the event streaming platforms are in the same operational domain.

Connectors are particularly useful for turning data at rest in such systems into data in motion. Taking a step back, we can see that pipelines in an Event Streaming Platform help companies build a \"central nervous system\" for data in motion. Implementation As an example we can use the streaming database ksqlDB to run a stream of events through a series of processing stages, thus creating a Pipeline that continuously processes data in motion.

Message-like events resemble simple facts - a user sends us their new address, a product leaves the warehouse - and we record those facts first, without immediately considering what happens next. Other events seem more like commands to invoke a specific action - a user clicks a [BUY] button - and it's time to trigger order processing. How do we model command-like events? Problem How can an Event Streaming Platform be used to invoke a procedure in another application? Solution Separate out the function call into a service that writes an event to an Event Stream , detailing the action we need to take and its arguments. Then write a separate service that watches for that event before invoking the procedure. Typically a Command Event is dispatched in a fire-and-forget manner. The writer assumes the event will be handled correctly, and responsibility for monitoring and error-handling lies elsewhere in the system. This is very similar to the Actor model. Actors have an inbox; we write messages to that inbox and trust they'll be handled in due course. If a return value is explicitly required, the downstream service can write a result event back to a second stream. Correlating Command Events with their return value is typically handled with a Correlation Identifier . Implementation Suppose we have a [BUY] button that should trigger a dispatchProduct(12005) function call in our warehousing system. Rather than calling the function directly, we can split the call up as a command stream: CREATE STREAM dispatch_products ( order_id BIGINT KEY, address VARCHAR ) WITH ( KAFKA_TOPIC = ' dispatch_products', VALUE_FORMAT = 'AVRO', PARTITIONS = 2 ); Some process that inserts into that stream: INSERT INTO dispatch_products ( order_id, address ) VALUES ( 12004, '1 Streetford Road' ); INSERT INTO dispatch_products ( order_id, address ) VALUES ( 12005, '2 Roadford Avenue' ); INSERT INTO dispatch_products ( order_id, address ) VALUES ( 12006, '3 Avenue Fordstreet' ); And a second process that watches the stream of events and invokes the dispatchProduct procedure foreach : ... Serde<GenericRecord> valueGenericAvroSerde = ... StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder(); KStream<Long, GenericRecord> dispatchStream = builder.stream( \"dispatch_products\", Consumed.with(Serdes.Long(), valueGenericAvroSerde) ); dispatchStream.foreach((key, value) -> warehouse.dispatchProduct(key, value)); Considerations This approach is fine and it works, but it may be a missed opportunity to improved the overall architecture. Consider what happens when we need more actions. Suppose that [BUY] should also trigger an email and a text notification to the customer. Should the warehouse software finish its work and then write SendEmail and SendText commands to two new topics? Or should these two new events be written by the same process that wrote DispatchProduct ? Then a month later, when we need our sales figures, should we count the number of products dispatched or the number of emails sent? Perhaps both, to check they agree? The system grows a little more and we have to ask, how much code is behind that [BUY] button? What's the release cycle? Is changing it becoming a blocker? [BUY] is important to the whole company, and rightly so, but its maintenance shouldn't hold the company to ransom. The root problem here is that in moving from a function call within a monolith to a system that posts a specific command to a specific recipient, we've decoupled the function call without decoupling the underlying concepts. When we do that, the architecture hits back with growing pains 1 . The real solution is to realize our \"Command Event\" is actually two concepts woven together: \"What happened?\" and \"Who cares?\" By teasing those concepts apart, we can clean up our architecture. We allow one process to focus on recording the facts of what happened, while other processes decide for themselves if they care. When the [BUY] click happens, we should just write an Order event. Then warehousing, notifications and sales can choose to react, without any need to coordinate. In short, commands are tightly coupled to an audience of one, whereas an event should just be a decoupled fact, available for anyone who's interested. Commands aren't bad per se , but they are a flag that signals an opportunity for further decoupling. Seeing systems this way requires a slight shift of perspective - a new way of modeling our processes - and opens up the opportunity for systems that collaborate more easily while actually taking on less individual responsibility. References This can approach become complex if there is a chain of functions, where the result of one is fed into the arguments of the next. In that situation, consider using Event Collaboration . See Designing Event Driven Systems - \"Chapter 5: Events: A Basis for Collaboration\" for further discussion This pattern is derived from Command Message in Enterprise Integration Patterns by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf Footnotes 1 It's at that point that someone in the team will say, \"We were better off just calling the function directly.\" And if we stopped there, they'd have a fair point.","title":"Command Event"},{"location":"event/command-event.html#command-event","text":"The Events in our systems often seem to fall into two categories: messages and commands.

It's essential that the communicating applications can understand how to process these shared Events . Problem How can an application send an Event such that a receiving application will know how to process it? Solution Using a Data Contract or Schema, different Event Processing Applications can share Events and understand how to process them without either the sender or receiver to know any details of the other. The Data Contract pattern allows these different applications to cooperate while remaining loosely coupled, and thus insulated from any internal changes they may implement. By implementing a data contract or schema, you can provide the same record consistency guarantees as a RDMS which integrate a schema by default. Implementation By using a schema to model event objects, Kafka clients (e.g., a Kafka producer, a Kafka Streams application, the streaming database ksqlDB ) can understand how to handle events from different applications using the same schema. For example, we can use Avro to describe a schema such as: { \"type\":\"record\", \"namespace\": \"io.confluent.developer.avro\", \"name\":\"Purchase\", \"fields\": [ {\"name\": \"item\", \"type\":\"string\"}, {\"name\": \"amount\", \"type\": \"double\"}, {\"name\": \"customer_id\", \"type\": \"string\"} ] } Additionally, using a central repository like Schema Registry makes it easy for Kafka clients to leverage schemas.

Problem How do I represent a fact about something that has happened? Solution An event represents an immutable fact about something that happened. Examples of Events might be: orders, payments, activities, or measurements. Events are produced to, stored in, and consumed from an Event Stream . An Event typically contains at least one or more data fields that describe the fact, as well as a timestamp that denotes when this Event was created by its Event Source . The Event may also contain various metadata about itself, such as its source of origin (e.g., the application or cloud services that created the event) and storage-level information (e.g., its position in the event stream). Implementation With Apache Kafka\u00ae, Events are referred to as records . Records are modeled as a key / value pair with a timestamp and optional metadata (called headers). The value of the record usually contains the representation of an application domain object or some form of raw message value, like the output of a sensor or other metric reading. The record key is useful for a few reasons, but critically they are used by Kafka to determine how the data is partitioned within a stream a.k.a. topic (see Partitioned Parallelism for more details on partitioning). Keys are often best thought of as a categorization of the Event, like the identity of a particular user or connected device. Headers are a place for record metadata which can help describe the Event data itself, and are themselves modeled as a map of keys and values. Record keys, values, and headers are opaque data types, meaning that Kafka, by deliberate design to achieve its high scalability and performance, does not define a type interface for them: they are read, stored, and written by Kafka's server-side brokers as raw arrays of bytes. Instead, it is the responsibility of Kafka's client applications like the streaming database ksqlDB or microservices implemented with the client libraries such as Kafka Streams or the Kafka Go client to perform the serialization and deserialization of the data within the record keys, values, and headers. When using the Java client library, events are created using the ProducerRecord type and sent to Kafka using the KafkaProducer . In this example, we have set the key and value types as strings and added a header: ProducerRecord<String, String> newEvent = new ProducerRecord<>( paymentEvent.getCustomerId().toString() /* key */, paymentEvent.toString() /* value */); producerRecord.headers() .add(\"origin-cloud\", \"aws\".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); producer.send(producerRecord); Considerations To ensure that Events from an Event Source can be read correctly by an Event Processor , they are often created in reference to an Event schema.

When the sequencing matters between events of different types and all those different event types are put into a single stream.

Problem How can an Event Processor apply a schema on the data it is reading from an Event Streaming Platform ? Solution The Schema-on-Read approach approach enables each reader to decide on how to read data, and which version of which schema to apply to every Event that it reads. To make schema management easier, the design can use a centralized repository that can store multiple versions of different schemas, and then the client applications then choose which schema to apply to events at runtime. Implementation With Confluent Schema Registry , all the schemas are managed in a centralized repository. In addition to just storing the schema information, Schema Registry can also be configured to check and/or enforce that schema changes are compatible with previous versions. For example, if a business started with a schema definition for an event that has 2 fields, but then the business needs evolved to now warrant an optional 3rd field, then that schema evolves with it. Schema Registry will ensure that the new schema is compatible with the old schema. In this particular case, for backward compatibility, the 3rd field status can be defined with a default value which will be used for the missing field when deserializing the data encoded with the old schema. This ensures that all events in a given stream follow Schema Compatibility rules, and the applications can continue to process those events. { \"namespace\": \"example.avro\", \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"user\", \"fields\": [ {\"name\": \"name\", \"type\": \"string\"}, {\"name\": \"address\", \"type\": \"string\"}, {\"name\": \"status\", \"type\": \"string\", \"default\": \"waiting\"} ] } In another example, if the use case warrants writing different event types into a single stream, with Apache Kafka you could set the \"subject naming strategy\" to register schemas against the record type, instead of the Kafka topic. Schema Registry will then let Schema Evolution and Schema Compatibility checking to happen within the scope of each event type instead of the topic. The consumer application can read schema versions assigned to the data type, and in the case where there are different data types in any given stream, the application can cast each event to the appropriate type at processing time and follow the appropriate code path: if (Account.equals(record.getClass()) { ... } else if (Approval.equals(record.getClass())) { ... } else if (Transaction.equals(record.getClass())) { ... } else { ... } Considerations The schema's subject naming strategy can be set to record type (instead of Kafka topic) in one of two ways.

Often these use cases are related to image, video, or audio processing: image recognition, video analytics, audio analytics, etc. Problem How can we handle use cases where the Event payload is too large or too expensive to move through the Event Streaming Platform ? Solution Instead of storing the entire event in the event streaming platform, store the event payload in a persistent external store that can be shared between producers and consumers. The producer can write the reference address into the event streaming platform, and downstream clients use the address to retrieve the event from the external store and then process it as needed. Implementation The event stored in Kafka contains only a reference to the object in the external store. This can be a full URI string, an abstract data type (e.g., Java object) with separate fields for bucket name and filename, or whatever fields are required to identify the object. Optionally, the event may contain additional data fields to better describe the object (e.g., metadata such as who created the object). The following example uses Kafka's Java producer client. Here, we keep things simple as the event's value stores no information other than the reference (URI) to its respective object in external storage. // Write object to external storage storageClient.putObject(bucketName, objectName, object); // Write URI to Kafka URI eventValue = new URI(bucketName, objectName); producer.send(new ProducerRecord<String, URI>(topic, eventKey, eventValue)); Considerations The Event Source is responsible for ensuring that the data is properly stored in the external store, such that the reference passed within the Event is valid.

Solution Instead of storing the entire event as a single event in the event streaming platform, break it into chunks (an approach called \"chunking\") so that the large event is sent across as multiple smaller events.

Event Processors are the building blocks for achieving this, but they solve only a specific part or step of a use case. Problem How can we build a full-fledged application for data in motion that creates, reads, processes, and/or queries Event Streams to solve a use case end-to-end? Solution We build an Event Processing Application by composing one or more Event Processors into an interconnected processing topology for Event Streams and Tables . Here, the continuous output streams of one processor are the continuous input streams to one or more downstream processors. The combined functionality of the application then covers our use case end-to-end, or at least as much of the use case as we are striving for (as the question of how few or many applications should implement a use case is an important design decision, which we are not covering here). The event processors\u2014and thus the application at large\u2014are typically distributed (running across multiple instances) to allow for elastic, parallel, fault-tolerant processing of data in motion at scale. For example, an application can read a stream of customer payments from an Event Store in an Event Streaming Platform , then filter payments for certain customers, and then aggregate those payments per country and per week.

There are several options for building Event Processing Applications when using Kafka, and we'll show two here. ksqlDB ksqlDB is a streaming database with which we can build Event Processing Applications using SQL syntax. It has first-class support for Streams and Tables . When we create Tables and Streams in ksqlDB, then Kafka topics are used as the storage layer behind the scenes. In the example below, the ksqlDB table movies is backed by a Kafka topic of the same name. CREATE TABLE movies (ID INT PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR, release_year INT) WITH (kafka_topic='movies', partitions=1, value_format='avro'); CREATE STREAM ratings (MOVIE_ID INT KEY, rating DOUBLE) WITH (kafka_topic='ratings', partitions=1, value_format='avro'); As one would expect, we can add new Events with INSERT : INSERT INTO movies (id, title, release_year) VALUES (294, 'Die Hard', 1998); INSERT INTO ratings (movie_id, rating) VALUES (294, 8.2); We can also perform stream processing with ksqlDB's SQL. The command CREATE STREAM .. AS SELECT .. in the following example continuously joins the ratings stream and the movies table to create a new stream of enriched ratings. CREATE STREAM rated_movies WITH (kafka_topic='rated_movies', value_format='avro') AS SELECT ratings.movie_id as id, title, rating FROM ratings LEFT JOIN movies ON ratings.movie_id = movies.id; Kafka Streams With the Kafka Streams client library of Apache Kafka, we implement an event processing application in Java, Scala, or other JVM languages. A Kafka Streams example similar to the ksqlDB one above is: KStream<Integer, Rating> ratings = builder.table(<blabla>); KTable<Integer, Movie> movies = builder.stream(<blabla>); MovieRatingJoiner joiner = new MovieRatingJoiner(); KStream <Integer, EnrichedRating> enrichedRatings = ratings.join(movies, joiner); See the tutorial How to join a stream and lookup table for a full example using Kafka Streams. Considerations When building an Event Processing Application, it's recommended to confine the application to one problem domain. While it's possible to use any number of event processors in the application, they should be closely related in most cases (similar to how one would design a microservice).

How do we do this? Problem How do we process Events in an Event Streaming Platform ? Solution We build an Event Processor, which is a component that reads Events and processes them, and possibly writes new Events as the result of its processing. As such, it may act as an Event Source and/or Event Sink , and in practice often acts as both. An event processor can be distributed, which means it has multiple instances that run across different machines. In this case the processing of Events happens concurrently across these instances. An important characteristic of an event processor is that it should allow for composition with other event processors. That's because, in practice, we rarely use a single event processor in isolation. Instead, we compose and connect (via Event Streams ) one or more event processors inside an Event Processing Application that fully implements one particular use case end-to-end, or (e.g., in the case of microservices) that implements a subset of the overall business logic limited to the bounded context of a particular domain. An event processor performs a specific task within the event processing application. Think of it as one processing node (or processing step) of a larger processing topology. Examples are the mapping of an event type to a domain object, filtering only the important events out of an Event Stream , enriching an event stream with additional data by joining it to another stream or database table, triggering alerts, or creating new events for consumption by other applications. Implementation There are multiple ways to create an Event Processing Application using Event Processors, we will look at two. ksqlDB The streaming database ksqlDB provides a familiar SQL syntax that allows us to create Event Processing Applications . ksqlDB takes parses SQL commands and constructs and manages the Event Processors we define as part of an Event Processing Application . In the following example, we create a ksqlDB query to reading data from the readings Event Stream and \"cleaning\" the Event values. The query publishes the clean readings to a new stream called clean_readings . Here, this query acts as an event processing application comprised of multiple event processors that are connected to each other. CREATE STREAM clean_readings AS SELECT sensor, reading, UCASE(location) AS location FROM readings EMIT CHANGES; With ksqlDB, we can view each section of the command as the construction of a different Event Processor: CREATE STREAM defines the new output Event Stream that this application will produce Events to. SELECT ... is a mapping function, taking each input Event and \"cleaning\" it as defined. In this example, this simply means upper casing the location field in each input reading. FROM ... is a source Event Processor that defines the input Event Stream for the overall application. EMIT CHANGES is ksqlDB syntax which defines our query as continuously running, and that incremental changes will be produced as the query runs perpetually. Kafka Streams The Kafka Streams DSL provides abstractions for Event Streams and Tables as well as stateful and stateless transformation functions ( map , filter , etc...). These functions act as the Event Processor in the larger Event Processing Application we build with the Kafka Streams library. builder .stream(\"readings\"); .mapValues((key, value)-> new Reading(value.sensor, value.reading, value.location.toUpperCase()) .to(\"clean\"); In the above example we use the Kafka Streams Builder to construct the stream processing topology. First we create an input stream with the stream function. This creates an Event Stream from the designated Kafka topic. Next we transform the Events using the mapValues function. This function accepts each Event and returns a new Event with any desired transformations to the values. Finally we write our transformed Events to a destination Kafka topic using the to function. This function terminates our stream processing topology. Considerations While it could be tempting to build a \"multi-purpose\" event processor, it's important that processors are designed in a composable way. By building processors as discrete units, it's easier to reason about what each processor does and, by extension, what the Event Processing Application does.

For relational databases, for example, a common technique is to use Change Data Capture , where changes to database tables\u2014such as INSERTs, UPDATES, DELETEs\u2014are captured as Events , which can then be ingested into another system. The components that perform this extraction and ingestion of Events are typically called \"connectors\". The connectors turn the origin system into an Event Source , then generate Events from that data, and finally sends these Events to the Event Streaming Platform . Implementation When connecting a cloud services and traditional systems to Apache Kafka\u00ae , the most common solution is to use Kafka Connect . There are hundreds of ready-to-use connectors available on Confluent Hub , including blob stores like AWS S3, cloud services like Salesforce and Snowflake, relational databases, data warehouses, traditional message queues, flat files, and more. Confluent also provides many fully managed Kafka connectors in the cloud. There are several options to deploy such connectors. For example, the streaming database ksqlDB provides an ability to manage Kafka connectors with SQL statements. CREATE SOURCE CONNECTOR `jdbc-connector` WITH( \"connector.class\"='io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSourceConnector', \"connection.url\"='jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/my.db', \"mode\"='bulk', \"topic.prefix\"='jdbc-', \"table.whitelist\"='users', \"key\"='username'); Considerations End-to-end data delivery guarantees (such as exactly-once delivery or at-least-once delivery) depend primarily on three factors: (1) the capabilities of the origin Event Source, such as a cloud service or relational database; (2) the capabilities of the Event Source Connector, and (3) the capabilities of the destination Event Streaming Platform, such as Apache Kafka or Confluent. Security policies as well as regulatory compliance may require appropriate settings for encrypted communication, authentication, and authorization, etc. between Event Source, Event Source Connector, and the destination Event Streaming Platform.

Solution Incoming events are stored in an Event Stream , implemented as an append-only log. By choosing this data structure, we can guarantee constant-time (\u0398(1)) writes, lock-free concurrent reads, and straightforward replication across multiple machines. Implementation Apache Kafka\u00ae is an event store that maintains a persistent, append-only stream \u2014 a topic \u2014 for each kind of event we need to store. These topics are: Write-efficient - an append-only log is one of the fastest, cheapest data structures to write to. Read efficient - multiple readers (cf. Event Processor ) can consume the same stream without blocking. Durable - all events are written to storage (e.g., local disk, network storage device), either synchronously (for maximum reliability) or asynchronously (for maximum throughput). Events can be as long-lived as needed, and even stored forever. Highly-available - each event is written to multiple storage devices and replicated across multiple machines, and in the case of failure one of the redundant machines takes over. Auditable - every change is captured and persisted. Every result can be traced back to its source event(s). Considerations It's worth briefly contrasting Apache Kafka\u00ae with message queues and relational databases. While queues also concern themselves with a stream of events, they often consider events as short-lived, independent messages. A message may only exist in memory, or it may be durable enough for data to survive server restarts, but in general they aren't intended to hold on to events for months or even years. Further, their querying capabilities may be limited to simple filtering, offloading more complex queries like joins and aggregations to the application level. In contrast, relational databases are very good at maintaining a persistent state of the world in perpetuity, and answering arbitrary questions about it, but they often fall short on auditing - answering which events led up to the current state - and on liveness - what new events do we need to consider.

Problem How can we ensure that events in a stream are retained forever? Solution The solution for infinite retention depends on the specific Event Streaming Platform . Some platforms support infinite retention \"out of the box\", requiring no action on behalf of the end users. If an Event Streaming Platform does not support infinite storage, infinite retention can be partially achieved with an Event Sink Connector pattern which offloads Events into permanent external storage. Implementation When using Confluent Cloud , infinite retention is built into the Event Streaming Platform ( availability may be limited based on cluster type and cloud provider ). Users of the platform can benefit from infinite storage without any changes to their client applications or operations. For on-premises Event Streaming Platforms , Confluent Platform adds the ability for infinite retention by extending Apache Kafka with Tiered Storage . Tiered storage separates the compute and storage layers, allowing the operator to scale either of those independently as needed. Newly arrived Events are considered \"hot\", but as time moves on, they become \"colder\" and migrate to more cost-effective external storage like an AWS S3 bucket. As cloud-native object stores can effectively scale to infinite size, the Kafka cluster can act as the system of record for infinite Event Streams .

Problem How can we remove events from an Event Stream based on a criteria, such as event age or Event Stream size? Solution The solution for limited retention will depend on the Event Streaming Platform . Most platforms will allow for deletion of events using an API or with an automated process configured within the platform itself. Because Event Streams are modeled as immutable event logs in the Event Store , events will be removed from the beginning of an Event Stream moving forward (i.e., oldest events are being removed first). Event Processing Applications that are reading from the stream will not be given the deleted events. Implementation Apache Kafka\u00ae implements a Limited Retention Event Stream by default. With Kafka, Event Streams are modeled as Topics . Kafka provides two types of retention policy, which can be configured on a per-topic basis or as a default for new topics. Time-Based Retention With time-based retention, events will be removed from the topic after the event timestamp indicates an event is older than the configured log retention time. On Kafka this is configured with the log.retention.hours setting, which can be set as a default to apply to all topics or on a per-topic basis. Additionally, Kafka respects a log.retention.minutes and log.retention.ms settings to define shorter retention periods. The following example sets the retention period of a topic to one year: log.retention.hours=8760 For more guidance and configuring time-based data retention, see the Kafka Broker Configurations documentation for default settings, or the Modifying Topics section for modifying existing topics. Size-Based Retention With size-based retention, events will begin to be removed from the topic once the total size of the topic violates the configured maximum size. Kafka supports a log.retention.bytes configure. For example, to configure the maximum size of a topic to 100GB you could set the configuration as follows: log.retention.bytes=107374127424 For more guidance and configuring size-based data retention, see the Kafka Broker Configurations documentation for default settings, or the Modifying Topics section for modifying existing topics. How Events Are Being Removed From an Event Stream For either method of configuring retention, Kafka does not immediately remove events one by one when they violate the configured retention settings. To understand how they are removed, we first need to explain that Kafka topics are further broken down into topic partitions (see Partitioned Placement ). Partitions themselves are further divided into files called segments .

Similarly, if we want to allow applications to reprocess the same events multiple times (often called the ability to reprocess historical data ) for use cases such as A/B testing or machine learning, then we must increase the retention settings accordingly. That's why it is common in practice to configure Kafka topics with long retention periods (months or years).

On the side of the organization, this loose coupling also allows different development teams to efficiently work independently from each another. Problem How can we decouple Event Sources from Event Sinks , both of which may include cloud services, systems like relational databases, as well as applications and microservices? Solution We use the Event Broker of an Event Streaming Platform for this decoupling. Typically, multiple such brokers are deployed as a distributed cluster to ensure elasticity, scalability, and fault-tolerance during operations. Event brokers collaborate on receiving and durably storing (write operations) as well as serving (read operations) Events into Event Streams from one or many clients in parallel. Clients that produce events are called the Event Sources , which are decoupled and isolated through the brokers from the clients that consume events, called the Event Sinks . Typically, the technical architecture follows the design of \"dumb brokers, smart clients\". Here, the broker intentionally limits its client-facing functionality to achieve the best performance and scalability. This means that additional work has to be performed by the broker's clients. For example, unlike in traditional messaging brokers, it is the responsibility of an event sink (consumer) to track its individual progress of reading and processing from an event stream. Implementation Apache Kafka\u00ae is an open-source distributed Event Streaming Platform , which implements this Event Broker pattern. Kafka runs as a highly scalable and fault-tolerant cluster of brokers. Many Event Processing Applications can produce, consume, and process Events from the cluster in parallel with strong guarantees such as transactions, using a fully decoupled yet coordinated architecture. Additionally, Kafka's protocol provides strong backwards and forwards compatibility guarantees between the server-side brokers and their client applications that produce, consume, and process events. For example, a cluster of brokers running an older version of Kafka can be used by client applications using a new version of Kafka. Similarly, older client applications keep working even when the cluster of brokers is upgraded to a newer version of Kafka (and Kafka also supports in-place version upgrades of clusters). This is another facet of decoupling the various components in a Kafka-based architecture, which results in even better flexibility during design and operations. Considerations Counter to traditional message brokers, event brokers provide a distributed, durable, and fault-tolerant storage layer. This has several important benefits. For instance, client applications can initiate and resume event production and consumption independently from each other. Similarly, they don't need to be connected to the brokers perpetually in order to not miss any events. When an application is taken offline for maintenance and subsequently restarted, then it will automatically resume its consumption and processing of an event stream exactly at the point where it stopped before.

In larger enterprises, multiple lines of business can complicate the situation even further. Modern software architectures, like microservices and SaaS applications, are also adding complexity as engineers are tasked with weaving the entire infrastructure together cohesively. Furthermore, companies can no longer survive without reacting to Events within their business in real-time. Customers and business partners expect immediate reactions and rich interactive applications. Today, data is in motion, and engineering teams needs to model applications to process business requirements as a stream of events, not as data at rest, sitting idly in a traditional data store. Problem What architecture can we use to model everything within our business as streams of events, creating a modern, fault tolerant, and scalable platform for building modern applications? Solution We can design business processes and applications around Event Streams . Everything from sales, orders, trades, customer experiences, sensor readings and database updates are modeled as an Event . Events are written to the Event Streaming Platform once, allowing distributed functions within the business to react in real-time. Systems external to the Event Streaming Platform are integrated using Event Sources and Event Sinks . Business logic is built within Event Processing Applications , which are composed of Event Processors that read and write events from Event Streams. Implementation Apache Kafka\u00ae is the most popular Event Streaming Platform, designed to address the business requirements in a modern distributed architecture. Kafka allows reading, writing, processing, querying, and reacting to Event Streams in a way that's horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant, and simple to use. Kafka is built upon many of the patterns described in this Event Streaming Patterns site. Fundamentals Data in Kafka is exchanged as events, which represent facts about something that has occurred. Examples of events include orders, payments, activities, or measurements. In Kafka, events are sometimes also referred to as records or messages , and they contain data and metadata describing the event. Events are written to, stored, and read from Event Streams . In Kafka, these streams are called topics . Topics have names and generally contain \"related\" records of a particular use case, such as customer payments. Topics are modeled as durable, distributed, append only logs in the Event Store . See this Apache Kafka 101 video for more details on Kafka topics. Applications that write events to topics are called Producers . Producers may come in many forms and can be generalized in the pattern Event Source . Reading events is performed by Consumers , which can be generalized into Event Sinks . Consumers typically operate in a distributed, coordinated fashion to increase scale and fault tolerance. Event Processing Applications act as both event sources and event sinks. Applications which use the basic producing and consuming described above are referred to as \"clients\". These client applications can be authored in a variety of programming languages, including: Java , Go , C/C++ , .NET , and Python . Stream Processing Event Processing Applications can be built using a variety of techniques on top of Kafka. ksqlDB The streaming database ksqlDB allows you to build Event Processing Applications using SQL syntax. It ships with an API, CLI, and UI. ksqlDB's elastic architecture decouples its distributed compute layer from its distributed storage layer, for which it uses and tightly integrates with Kafka. Kafka Streams The Kafka Streams client library of Apache Kafka allows you to build elastic applications and microservices on the JV, with languages like Java and Scala. An application can run in a distributed fashion across multiple instances for better scalability and fault-tolerance. Data Integrations The Kafka Connect framework of Apache Kafka allows you to scalably and reliably integrate cloud services and data systems external to Kafka into the Event Streaming Platform. Here, data of these systems is set in motion by continuously importing and/or exporting this data as Event Streams through Kafka connectors . There are hundreds of ready-to-use Kafka connectors available on Confluent Hub . On-boarding existing data systems onto Kafka is often the first step in the journey of adopting an Event Streaming Platform.

Being able to distribute events and process them concurrently enables an application to scale. Problem How can we allocate events across Event Streams and Tables so that they can be processed concurrently by distributed Event Processors ? Solution We should use a partitioned event stream, and then assign the events to different partitions of the stream. Essentially, a partition is a unit of parallelism for storage as well as reading, writing, and processing events. Partitioning helps concurrency and scalability in these main ways: Platform scalability: enables different Event Brokers to store and serve Events to Event Processing Applications concurrently Application scalability: enable different Event Processing Applications to process Events concurrently Partitioning events also impacts application semantics: placing events into a given partition guarantees that the ordering of events is preserved, per partition (but typically not across different partitions of the same stream). This ordering guarantee is crucial for many use cases as, very often, the sequencing of events matters, e.g., when processing retail orders (an order must be paid before it can be shipped). Implementation With Apache Kafka\u00ae, streams (called topics ) are created either by an administrator or by a streaming application like ksqlDB . The number of partitions is specified at the time the topic is created. For example: ccloud kafka topic create myTopic --partitions 30 Events are placed into a specific partition according to the partitioning algorithm of the Event Source , such as an Event Processing Application . All events assigned into the same partition have strong ordering guarantees. The common partitioning schemes are: Partitioning based on the event key (e.g., the customer ID for a stream of customer payments), where events with the same key are stored in the same partition Partitioning events round-robin across all partitions to achieve an even distribution of events per partition A custom partitioning algorithm, tailored to a specific use case.

Problem How can we group individual but related events from the same Event Stream or Table , so that they can subsequently be processed as a whole? Solution For time-based grouping a.k.a. time-based windowing , we use an Event Processor that groups the related events into windows based on their event timestamps. Most window types have a pre-defined window size, such as 10 minutes or 24 hours.

Many operations in an Event Processor are dependent on time, such as joins, aggregations when computed over a window of time (e.g., 5-minute averages), and the handling out-of-order and \"late\" data. In many systems, developers have the choice between different variants of time for an event: Event-time, which captures the time at which an event was originally created by its Event Source . Ingestion-time, which captures the time an event was received on the event stream in an Event Streaming Platform . Wallclock-time or processing-time, which is the time at which a downstream Event Processor happens to process the event (which can be milliseconds, hours, months, etc. after event-time) . Depending on the use case, developers need to pick one variant over the others. Problem How do we implement event-time based processing of events? Solution For event-time processing, the Event Source must include a timestamp in the event (e.g., in a data field or header metadata) that denotes the time at which the event was created by the source. Then, on the consuming side in an Event Processing Application , we need to extract this timestamp from the event, which allows the application process events based on their original timeline. Implementation ksqlDB In the streaming database ksqlDB, every event/record has a system-column named ROWTIME representing the timestamp for the event, which defaults to the time at which the event was originally created by its Event Source . For example, when we create a ksqlDB STREAM or TABLE from an existing Kafka topic, then the timestamp embedded in a Kafka message is extracted and assigned to the event in ksqlDB. (cf. CreateTime of a Kafka ProducerRecord and the Kafka message format ). Sometimes, this default behavior of ksqlDB is not what we want. Maybe the events have a custom data field containing their actual timestamps (e.g., some legacy data that has been around for a while was ingested into Kafka only recently, so we can't trust the CreateTime information in the Kafka messages because they are much newer than the original timestamps). To use a timestamp in the event payload itself, we can add a WITH(TIMESTAMP='some-field') clause when creating a stream or table, which instructs ksqlDB to get the timestamp from the specified field in the record: CREATE STREAM my_event_stream WITH (kafka_topic='events', timestamp='eventTime'); Kafka Streams The Kafka Streams client library of Apache Kafka provides the TimestampExtractor interface for extracting the timestamp from events. The default implementation retrieves the timestamp from the Kafka message (see discussion above) as set by the producer of the message. Normally, this setup results in event-time processing, which is what we want. But for those cases where we need the timestamp from the event payload, we can create our own TimestampExtractor implementation: class OrderTimestampExtractor implements TimestampExtractor { @Override public long extract(ConsumerRecord<Object, Object> record, long partitionTime) { ElectronicOrder order = (ElectronicOrder)record.value(); return order.getTime(); } Generally speaking, this functionality of custom timestamp assignment makes it easy to integrate data from other applications that are not using Kafka Streams or ksqlDB themselves. Additionally, Kafka has the notion of event-time vs. processing-time (wallclock) vs. ingestion time, similar to ksqlDB. Clients like Kafka Streams make it possible to select which variant of time we want to work with in our application. Considerations When considering which time semantics to use, it comes down to the problem domain. In most cases, event-time processing is the recommended option. For example, when re-processing historical event streams (such as for A/B testing, for training machine learning models), only event-time yields correct processing results. If we use processing-time (wall-clock time) to process the last four weeks of events, then an Event Processor will falsely believe that these four weeks of data were created just now in a matter of minutes, which totally breaks the original timeline and temporal distribution of the data and thus leads to incorrect processing results. The difference of event-time to ingestion-time is typically less pronounced than to processing-time as described above, but ingestion-time still suffers from the same conceptual discrepancy between when an event actually occurred in the real world (event-time) vs. when the event was received and stored in the Event Streaming Platform (ingestion-time).

It's often the case that when two separate Events occur, it triggers a new fact that we want to capture. A product can only be dispatched when there's an order and a successful payment. If someone places a bet and their horse wins, then we transfer money to them. How do we combine information from several different event streams and use them to make new events? Problem How can an application trigger processing when two (or more) related events arrive on different streams? Solution Multiple streams of events can be joined together, similar to joins in a relational database. We watch the streams and remember their most recent events (e.g., via an in-memory cache, a local or network storage device) for a certain amount of time. Whenever a new event arrives, we consider it alongside the other recently-captured events and look for matches. If we find one, we emit a new event. For stream-stream joins, it's important to think about what we consider to be a \"recent\" event. We can't join brand new events with arbitrarily-old ones - to join potentially-infinite streams would require potentially-infinite memory. Instead we decide on a retention period that counts as \"new enough\", and only hold on to events in that period. This is often just fine - a payment will usually happen soon after a order is placed. If it doesn't go through within the hour, we can reasonably expect a different process to chase the user for updated credit card details. Implementation As an example, imagine a bank that captures logins to their website, and withdrawals from an ATM. The fraud department might be keen to hear if the same user_id logs in in one country, and makes a withdrawal in a different country, within the same day. (This would not necessarily be fraud, but it's certainly suspicious!) To implement this example, we'll use ksqlDB.

If the input data is not windowed (cf. Event Grouper ), the aggregator will emit \"intermediate\" processing results. That's because an event stream is potentially infinite, so generally we do not know when the input is considered \"complete\". So, with few exceptions, there's not really a point where we can have a \"final\" result. However, if the input data is windowed (e.g., the input is grouped into 5-minute windows in order to compute 5-minute averages), then emitting a \"final\" result per window is possible, because the aggregator knows when the input for a given window is considered complete, and thus it can be configured to suppress \"intermediate\" results until the window time passes. Problem How can an event aggregator provide a final aggregation result, rather than \"intermediate\" results that keep being updated? Solution First, the input events of the aggregator must be windowed via an Event Grouper , i.e., the events are being grouped into \"windows\" based on their timestamps. Depending on the configured grouping, an event is placed exclusively into a single window, or it can be placed into multiple windows. Then, the event aggregator performs its operation on each window. Only once the window is considered to have \"passed\" (e.g., a 5-minute window starting at 09:00am and ending at 09:05am) will the aggregator output a single, final result for this window. For example, consider an aggregation for an event stream of customer payments, where we want to compute the number of payments per hour. By using a window size of 1 hour, we can emit a final count for the hourly number of payments once the respective 1-hour window closes. Ideally, the aggregator is able to handle out-of-order or \"late\" events, which is a common situation to deal with in an event streaming platform (e.g., an event created at 09:03 arrives only at 09:07). Here, a common technique is to let users define a so-called grace period for windows to give delayed events some extra time to arrive. Events that arrive within the grace period of a window will be processed, whereas any later events will be not be processed (e.g., if the grace period is 3 minutes, then the 09:03 event arriving at 09:07 would be included in the 09:00-09:05 window; any events arriving at or after 09:08 would be ignored by this window). Note that the use of a grace period increases the processing latency, because the aggregator has to wait for an additional period of time before it knows the input for a given window is complete and thus before it can output the single, final result for that window. Implementation For Apache Kafka\u00ae, the Kafka Streams client library provides a suppress operator in its DSL, which we can apply to windowed aggregations. In the following example we compute hourly aggregations on a stream of orders, using a grace period of five minutes to wait for any orders arriving with a slight delay. The suppress operator ensures that there's only a single result event for each hourly window. KStream<String, OrderEvent> orderStream = builder.stream(...); orderStream.groupByKey() .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofHours(1)).grace(Duration.ofMinutes(5))) .aggregate(() -> 0.0 /* initial value of `total`, per window */, (key, order, total) -> total + order.getPrice(), Materialized.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Double())) .suppress(untilWindowCloses(unbounded())) .toStream() .map((windowKey, value) -> KeyValue.pair(windowKey.key(),value)) .to(outputTopic, Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Double())); Considerations To honor the contract of outputting only a single result per window, the suppressed aggregator typically buffers events in some way until the window closes.

We have a stream of login events, we'd like to know when each user last logged in. Our trucks send GPS data every minute, we'd like to know where each truck is right now. How do we roll up data efficiently? How do we preserve a complete event log and enjoy the fast queries of an \"update in place\"-style database? Problem How can a stream of change events be summarized into the current state of the world, efficiently? Solution We can maintain projection tables that behave just like materialized views in a traditional database. As new events come in, the table is automatically updated, giving us an always-live picture of the system. Events with the same key are considered related, with newer events being interpreted as updates or deletions (depending on their contents) of older events. Like a materialized view, projection tables are read-only. To change them, we change the underlying data by recording new events to their underlying streams. Implementation ksqlDB supports easy creation of summary tables/materialized views. We declare them once, and the server will maintain their data as new events stream in. As an example, imagine we are shipping packages around the world. As they reach each point on their journey, they're logged with their current location. We'll start with a stream of check-in events: CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM package_checkins ( package_id BIGINT KEY, location VARCHAR, processed_by VARCHAR ) WITH ( KAFKA_TOPIC = 'package_checkins_topic', VALUE_FORMAT = 'AVRO', PARTITIONS = 3 ); Then we'll create a projection table, tracking each package_id and the newest location : CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE package_locations AS SELECT package_id, LATEST_BY_OFFSET(location) AS current_location FROM package_checkins GROUP BY package_id; Querying that stream in one terminal: SELECT * FROM package_locations EMIT CHANGES; ...and inserting some data in another: INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 1, 'New York' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 1, 'London' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 2, 'London' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 1, 'Paris' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 3, 'Paris' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 2, 'Paris' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 3, 'London' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 1, 'Rome' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 2, 'Rome' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 3, 'Washington' ); Results in a table of each package's last-known location: +------------+------------------+ |PACKAGE_ID |CURRENT_LOCATION | +------------+------------------+ |1 |Rome | |2 |Rome | |3 |Washington | As new data is inserted, package_locations stays updated, so we can see the current location of each package without scanning through the event history every time. Considerations In the example above, it's important to consider partitioning. When we declared the package_checkins stream, we marked the package_id as the KEY . This ensures that all events with the same package_id will be stored in the same partition, in turn ensuring that for a given package_id , newer events have a higher offset value. Thus when we query for the LATEST_BY_OFFSET , we're always getting the newest event for each package. If we'd chosen a different partitioning key, or not specified one at all, we'd get very different results. LATEST_BY_OFFSET is only one of the many summary functions ksqlDB supports , from simple sums and averages to time-aware functions and histograms. And beyond those, we can easily define our own custom functions or look to Kafka Streams for complete control. References Aggregate functions in the ksqlDB documentation.

As new events come in, the table is automatically updated, giving us an always-live picture of the system. Events with the same key are considered related, with newer events being interpreted as updates or deletions (depending on their contents) of older events. Like a materialized view, projection tables are read-only. To change them, we change the underlying data by recording new events to their underlying streams.","title":"Solution"},{"location":"table/projection-table.html#implementation","text":"ksqlDB supports easy creation of summary tables/materialized views. We declare them once, and the server will maintain their data as new events stream in. As an example, imagine we are shipping packages around the world. As they reach each point on their journey, they're logged with their current location. We'll start with a stream of check-in events: CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM package_checkins ( package_id BIGINT KEY, location VARCHAR, processed_by VARCHAR ) WITH ( KAFKA_TOPIC = 'package_checkins_topic', VALUE_FORMAT = 'AVRO', PARTITIONS = 3 ); Then we'll create a projection table, tracking each package_id and the newest location : CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE package_locations AS SELECT package_id, LATEST_BY_OFFSET(location) AS current_location FROM package_checkins GROUP BY package_id; Querying that stream in one terminal: SELECT * FROM package_locations EMIT CHANGES; ...and inserting some data in another: INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 1, 'New York' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 1, 'London' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 2, 'London' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 1, 'Paris' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 3, 'Paris' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 2, 'Paris' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 3, 'London' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 1, 'Rome' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 2, 'Rome' ); INSERT INTO package_checkins ( package_id, location ) VALUES ( 3, 'Washington' ); Results in a table of each package's last-known location: +------------+------------------+ |PACKAGE_ID |CURRENT_LOCATION | +------------+------------------+ |1 |Rome | |2 |Rome | |3 |Washington | As new data is inserted, package_locations stays updated, so we can see the current location of each package without scanning through the event history every time.","title":"Implementation"},{"location":"table/projection-table.html#considerations","text":"In the example above, it's important to consider partitioning. When we declared the package_checkins stream, we marked the package_id as the KEY . This ensures that all events with the same package_id will be stored in the same partition, in turn ensuring that for a given package_id , newer events have a higher offset value. Thus when we query for the LATEST_BY_OFFSET , we're always getting the newest event for each package. If we'd chosen a different partitioning key, or not specified one at all, we'd get very different results. LATEST_BY_OFFSET is only one of the many summary functions ksqlDB supports , from simple sums and averages to time-aware functions and histograms. And beyond those, we can easily define our own custom functions or look to Kafka Streams for complete control.","title":"Considerations"},{"location":"table/projection-table.html#references","text":"Aggregate functions in the ksqlDB documentation.

The state is similar to a table in a relational database and is mutable, i.e., it allows for read and write operations. It is essential that the event processor has an efficient and fault-tolerant mechanism for state management, i.e, recording and updating the state while processing input events, to ensure correctness of computations and preventing data loss as well as data duplication. Problem How can an Event Processor manage (mutable) state, similar to a table in a relational database? Solution We need to implement a mutable state table that allows the Event Processor to record and update state. For example, to count the number of payments per customer, the state table provides a mapping between the customer (e.g., a customer ID) and the current count of payments. The state's storage backend can vary by implementation: options include local state stores (e.g., RocksDB), remote state stores (e.g., AWS DynamoDB or a NoSQL database), or in-memory caches. Local state stores are usually recommended as they do not incur additional latency for network roundtrips, which improves the end-to-end performance of the Event Processor. Irrespective of backend choice, the state table should be fault-tolerant to ensure strong processing guarantees, such as exactly-once semantics. Fault-tolerance can be achieved, for example, by attaching an Event Source Connector to the state table to perform change data capture (CDC), thus allowing the Event Processor to continuously backup state changes into an Event Stream and, whenever needed, restore the state table in the case of failure or similar scenarios.here is no network latency to contend with. Also, an approach for restoring the state after a crash destroying the local store occurs. Implementation ksqlDB provides state tables out of the box with its TABLE data collection. Its implementation uses local, fault-tolerant state stores that are continuously backed up into ksqlDB's distributed storage layer (Kafka) so the data is durable. For example, we can maintain a stateful count of all sales with by aggregating the movie_ticket_sales stream into a movie_tickets_sold table: CREATE TABLE movie_tickets_sold AS SELECT title, COUNT(ticket_total_value) AS tickets_sold FROM movie_ticket_sales GROUP BY title EMIT CHANGES; References State store recovery in ksqlDB explains the fault-tolerance of ksqlDB's state management in more detail.
