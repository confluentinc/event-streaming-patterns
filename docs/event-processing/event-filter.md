# Event Filter
[Event Processing Applications](event-processing-application.md) may need to operate over a subset of [Events](../event/event.md) in an [Event Stream](../event-stream/event-stream.md).

## Problem
How can an application select only the relevant events (or discard uninteresting events) from an Event Stream?

## Solution
![event-filter](../img/event-filter.svg)

## Implementation

As an example, the streaming database [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io) provides the ability to create a filtered Event Stream using familiar SQL syntax:
```sql
CREATE STREAM payments_only WITH (kafka_topic = 'transactions-topic') AS
    SELECT *
      FROM all_transactions
      WHERE type = 'purchase';
```

The [Kafka Streams client library](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/streams/index.html) of Apache KafkaÂ® provides a `filter` operator in its DSL, which filters out events that do not match a given predicate.

```java
builder
  .stream("transactions-topic")
  .filter((key, transaction) -> transaction.type == "purchase")
  .to("payments-topic");
```
