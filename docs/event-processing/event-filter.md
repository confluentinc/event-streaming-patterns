# Event Filter
[Event Processing Applications](event-processing-application.md) may need to operate over a subset of [Events](../event/event.md) in an [Event Stream](../event-stream/event-stream.md).

## Problem
How can an application select only the relevant events (or discard uninteresting events) from an Event Stream?

## Solution
![event-filter](../img/event-filter.png)


## Implementation
The Kafka Streams DSL provides a `filter` operator which filters out events that do not match a given predicate.

```
KStream<String, Event> eventStream = builder.stream(.....);
eventStream.filter((key, value) -> value.type() == "foo").to("foo-events");
```
