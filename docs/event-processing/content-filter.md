  title: Content Filter
  description: A Content Filter allows an Event Processing Application to tailor events to particular use-cases, filtering out unwanted fields so we can focus on the most relevant information.

# Content Filter

[Events](../event/event.md) in an [Event Processing
Applications](event-processing-application.md) can often be very
large. We tend to capture data exactly as it arrives, and then work on
it, rather than processing it first and only storing the results. So
it can often be the case that the event we want to consume has much
more information in it than we actually need for the task in hand.

For example, we might pull in a product feed from a 3rd party API and
store that data exactly as it was received. Later, we might ask the
question, "How many products are in each product category?"  and find
that every event contains 100 fields, when we're really only
interested in counting one. At the very least this is inefficient -
the network, memory and serialization costs are 100x higher than they
need to be.  But if we need to manually inspect the data, this
actually becomes painful; hunting through 100 fields to find and check
the one we care about.

Equally we may have security and data privacy concerns to
address. Imagine we have a stream of data representing users' personal
details and site preferences. If the marketing department wants to get
more information about our global customer base, we might be able to
share the users' timezone and currency settings, but _only those
fields_.

We need a method of storing complete events while only giving
consumers a subset of their fields.

## Problem

How do I simplify dealing with a large event when I am interested only
in a few data items?

## Solution

![content filter](../img/content-filter.svg)

Create an [Event Processor](./event-processor.md) that inspects each
event, pulls out the fields of interest, and passes new, smaller
events downstream for further processing.

## Implementation

As an example, in the streaming database [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io/)
we can easily transform a rich event stream into a stream of simpler
event with a `SELECT` statement.

For instance, assume we have an event stream called `products` where
each event contains a huge number of fields. We can prune this down
with:

But we are only interested in 4 fields `producer_id`, `category`,
`sku`, and `price`. We can prune down the events to just those fields
with:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM product_summaries AS
  SELECT
    product_id,
    category,
    sku,
    price
  FROM products;
```

Or we can do the equivalent transformation using the [Kafka Streams client library](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/streams/index.html) of Apache KafkaÂ®,
perhaps as part of a larger processing pipeline:

```java
builder.stream("products", Consumed.with(Serdes.Long(), productSerde))
    .mapValues(
        (product) -> {
          ProductSummary summary = new ProductSummary();

          summary.setCategory(product.getCategory());
          summary.setSku(product.getSku());
          summary.setPrice(product.getPrice());

          return summary;
        })
    .to("product_summaries", Produced.with(Serdes.Long(), productSummarySerde));
```

## Considerations


Since filtering the content creates a new stream, it's worth
considering how the new stream will be partitioned with [Partitioned
Placement](../event-stream/partitioned-placement.md). By default the
new stream will inherit the same partitioning key as its source, but
by e.g. specifying a `PARTITION BY` clause in ksqlDB, we can repartition the data to
suit the new use case.

In the example above, our 3rd party product feed might be partitioned
by the vendor's unique `product_id`, but for this use case it might
make more sense to partition the filtered events by their `category`.

See the [ksqlDB
documentation](https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/ksqldb-reference/create-stream-as-select/)
for details.
