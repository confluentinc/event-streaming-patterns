   title: Event Router
   description: Event Routers are used to route Events to different Event Streams based on data or metadata values contained in each Event.

# Event Router
[Event Streams](../event-stream/event-stream.md) may contain a subset of [Events](../event/event.md) which need to be processed in isolation. For example, an inventory check system may be distributed across multiple physical systems, and the target system depends on the category of the item being checked. 

## Problem
How can we isolate [Events](../event/event.md) into a dedicated [Event Stream](../event-stream/event-stream.md) based on some attribute of the [Events](../event/event.md)?

## Solution
![event-router](../img/event-router.svg)

## Implementation
With [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io/), we can continuously route events to a different stream using the `CREATE STREAM` syntax with an appropriate `WHERE` filter.

```
CREATE STREAM payments ...;

CREATE STREAM payments_france AS
    SELECT * FROM payments WHERE country = 'france';

CREATE STREAM payments_spain AS
    SELECT * FROM payments WHERE country = 'spain';
```

With the [Kafka Streams library](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/), use a [TopicNameExtractor](https://kafka.apache.org/28/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/TopicNameExtractor.html) to route events to different streams (topics).  The `TopicNameExtractor` has one method to implement, `extract()`, which accepts three parameters:

- The event key
- The event value
- The [RecordContext](https://kafka.apache.org/28/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/RecordContext.html), which provides access to headers, partitions, and other contextual information about the event.

We can use any of the given parameters to generate and return the desired destination topic name for the given event, and Kafka Streams will complete the routing. 

```java
CountryTopicExtractor implements TopicNameExtractor<String, String> {
   String extract(String key, String value, RecordContext recordContext) {
      switch (value.country) {
        case "france":
          return "france-topic";
        case "spain":
          return "spain-topic";
      }
   }
}

KStream<String, String> myStream = builder.stream(...);
myStream.mapValues(..).to(new CountryTopicExtractor());
```

## Considerations
* Event Routers should not modify the Event itself and instead only provide the proper routing to the desired destinations.
* Consider the use of an [Event Envelope](../event/event-envelope.md) if an event router should attach additional information or context to an event.
