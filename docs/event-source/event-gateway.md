# Event Gateway

One of the key benefits of adopting an
[Event](../event/event.md)-first architecture is to foster
collaboration. Our aim is to ensure that Team A can produce data, Team
B can process it and Team C can report on it, with only one thing
coupling the teams together - the data itself.  Teams shouldn't have
to agree on shared libraries, synchronized release schedules, or
common tooling. Data becomes the one true interface.

In reality though, each team will still have to communicate with the
[Event Store][event_store] itself. How do we maximize access? How do
we ensure that every team can use the event store, without insisting
they choose from a shortlist of supported languages?  How do we
accommodate the team that insists on using Idris<sup>+</sup>?

<i><sup>+</sup>Or Haskell, or Rust, or Erlang, or whatever other
language we didn't plan for...</i>

## Problem

How does an an [Event Streaming
Platform](../event-stream/event-streaming-platform.md) provide access
to the widest-possible range of users?

## Solution

![event-gateway](../img/event-gateway.svg)

Provide an event gateway via a standardized, well-supported interface
that gives access to the widest possible range of users.

## Implementation

Confluent provides a broad set of [REST APIs][rest_apis] that allow any
language or CLI to access the event store using HTTP(S). Further, it provides
support to produce and consume Apache KafkaÂ® data, formatted as JSON, Protobuf, Avro or
even raw base64-encoded bytes.

As a simple example, we can post JSON-encoded events to a topic called
`sales` using [curl][curl]:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.json.v2+json" \
  --data '{"records":[{"key":"alice","value":{"tickets":5}},{"key":"bob","value":{"tickets":10}}]}' \
  http://localhost:8082/topics/sales
```

```json
{
  "offsets": [
    {
      "partition": 0,
      "offset": 0,
      "error_code": null,
      "error": null
    },
    {
      "partition": 0,
      "offset": 1,
      "error_code": null,
      "error": null
    }
  ],
  "key_schema_id": null,
  "value_schema_id": null
}
```

## Considerations

In a perfect world, every Event Streaming Platform (and every relational
database) would have first-class support for every language. Realistically some
languages will be better accommodated than others, but we can still ensure
every language has access to every important feature through a standards-based
interface.
