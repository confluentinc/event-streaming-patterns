# Event Source Connector
[Event Processing Applications](../event-processing/event-processing-application.md) may want to consume data from existing data systems, which are not themselves [Event Sources](event-source.md).

## Problem
How can we connect cloud services and traditional systems, like relational databases, to an [Event Streaming Platform](../event-stream/event-streaming-platform.md), converting their data at rest to data in motion with [Events](../event/event.md)?

## Solution
![event-source-connector](../img/event-source-connector.svg)

Generally speaking, we need to find a way to extract data as [Events](../event/event.md) from the origin system. For relational databases, for example, a common technique is to use [Change Data Capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture), where changes to database tables—such as INSERTs, UPDATES, DELETEs—are captured as [Events](../event/event.md), which can then be ingested into another system. The components that perform this extraction and ingestion of [Events](../event/event.md) are typically called "connectors". The connectors turn the origin system into an [Event Source](../event-source/event-source.md), then generate [Events](../event/event.md) from that data, and finally sends these [Events](../event/event.md) to the [Event Streaming Platform](../event-stream/event-streaming-platform.md).

## Implementation
When connecting a cloud services and traditional systems to [Apache Kafka®](https://kafka.apache.org/), the most common solution is to use [Kafka Connect](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/index.html). There are hundreds of ready-to-use connectors available on [Confluent Hub](https://www.confluent.io/hub/), including blob stores like AWS S3, cloud services like Salesforce and Snowflake, relational databases, data warehouses, traditional message queues, flat files, and more. Confluent also provides many [fully managed Kafka connectors](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/index.html) in the cloud.

There are several options to deploy such connectors. For example, the streaming database [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io/) provides an ability to manage Kafka connectors with SQL statements.
```
CREATE SOURCE CONNECTOR `jdbc-connector` WITH(
    "connector.class"='io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSourceConnector',
    "connection.url"='jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/my.db',
    "mode"='bulk',
    "topic.prefix"='jdbc-',
    "table.whitelist"='users',
    "key"='username');
```

## Considerations
* End-to-end data delivery guarantees (such as exactly-once delivery or at-least-once delivery) depend primarily on three factors: (1) the capabilities of the origin Event Source, such as a cloud service or relational database; (2) the capabilities of the Event Source Connector, and (3) the capabilities of the destination Event Streaming Platform, such as Apache Kafka or Confluent.
* Security policies as well as regulatory compliance may require appropriate settings for encrypted communication, authentication, and authorization, etc. between Event Source, Event Source Connector, and the destination Event Streaming Platform.
