# Event Source 
Various components in an [Event Streaming Platform](../event-stream/event-streaming-platform.md) will generate [Events](../event/event.md). An Event Source is the generalization of these components, which can include [Event Processing Applications](../event-processing/event-processing-application.md), cloud services, databases, IoT sensors, mainframes, and more.

Conceptually, an event source is the opposite of an [Event Sink](../event-sink/event-sink.md). In practice, however, components such as an event processing application can act as both an event source and an event sink.

## Problem
How can we create [Events](../event/event.md) in an [Event Streaming Platform](../event-stream/event-streaming-platform.md)?

## Solution
![event-source](../img/event-source.svg)

Use an Event Source, which typically acts as a client in an [Event Streaming Platform](../event-stream/event-streaming-platform.md). Examples are an [Event Source Connector](../event-source/event-source-connector.md) (which continuously imports data as [Event Streams](../event-stream/event-stream.md) into the [Event Streaming Platform](../event-stream/event-streaming-platform.md) from an external system such as a cloud service or a relational database), or an [Event Processing Application](../event-processing/event-processing-application.md), such as a [Kafka Streams](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/streams/index.html) application or the streaming database [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io/).

## Implementation
Normally, an actual component such as an application for Apache KafkaÂ® would be writing [Events](../event/event.md) into an [Event Stream](../event-stream/event-stream.md) via a client library, API, gateway, etc. We can also write events directly using SQL syntax; the streaming database [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io/), for example, provides an `INSERT` statement.
```
CREATE STREAM users (username VARCHAR, name VARCHAR, phone VARCHAR)
	with (kafka_topic='users-topic', value_format='json');
INSERT INTO users (username, name, phone)
  VALUES ('awilson', 'Allison', '+1 555-555-1234');
```
