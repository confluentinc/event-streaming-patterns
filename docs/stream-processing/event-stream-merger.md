# Event Stream Merger
An [Event Streaming Application](../event-processing/event-processing-application.md) may contain multiple [Event Stream](../event-stream/event-stream.md) instances.  But in some cases it may make sense for the application to merge the different event streams into a single event stream, without changing the individual events.  While this may seem logically related to a join, the merge is a completely different operation.  A join produces results by combining events with the same key to produce a new event, possibly of a different type.  Whereas the merge combines the events from multiple streams into a single stream, but the individual events are unchanged and remain independent of each other.  

## Problem
How can an application merge different event streams?

## Solution
![event-stream-merger](../img/event-stream-merger.png)


## Implementation
The Kafka Streams DSL provides a `merge` operator which merges two streams into a single stream. We can then take the merged stream and use any number of operations on it.

```java
KStream<String, Event> eventStream = builder.stream(...);
KStream<String, Event> eventStreamII = builder.stream(...);
KStream<String, Event> allEventsStream = eventStream.merge(eventStreamII);

allEventsStream.groupByKey()...
```

## Considerations

* Kafka Streams provides no guarantees on the processing order of records from the underlying streams.
* When merging streams the key and value types must be the same.
