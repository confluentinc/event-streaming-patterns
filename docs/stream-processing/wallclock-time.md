  title: Wallclock-Time Processing
  description: Process Events from an Event Source, taking into account different ways of handling timestamps, wall-clock time, and processing time.

# Wall-Clock-Time Processing
Consistent time semantics are of particular importance in stream processing. Many operations in an [Event Processor](../event-processing/event-processor.md) are dependent on time, such as joins, aggregations when computed over a window of time (e.g., five-minute averages), and handling out-of-order and "late" data. In many systems, developers have a choice between different variants of time for an [Event](../event/event.md):

1. Event-time, which captures the time at which an Event was originally created by its Event Source.
2. Ingestion-time, which captures the time at which an Event was received on the Event Stream in an [Event Streaming Platform](../event-stream/event-streaming-platform.md).
3. Wall-clock-time or processing-time, which is the time at which a downstream Event Processor happens to process an Event (potentially milliseconds, hours, months, or more after event-time). 

Depending on the use case, developers need to pick one variant over the others.

## Problem
How can Events from an [Event Source](../event-source/event-source.md) be processed irrespective of the timestamps from when they were originally created by the Event Source?

## Solution
![wallclock-time](../img/wallclock-time.svg)

Depending on the use case, [Event Processors](../event-processing/event-processor.md) may use the time when the Event was originally created by its [Event Source](../event-source/event-source.md), the time when it was received on the Event Stream in the [Event Streaming Platform](../event-stream/event-streaming-platform.md), or a time derived from one or more data fields provided by the [Event](../event/event.md) itself (i.e., from the Event payload).

## Implementation

As an example, the streaming database [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io) maintains a system column called `ROWTIME`, which tracks the timestamp of an [Event](../event/event.md). By default, `ROWTIME` is inherited from the timestamp in the underlying Apache KafkaÂ® record metadata, but it can also be pulled from a field in the [Event](../event/event.md). See [Time semantics](https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/concepts/time-and-windows-in-ksqldb-queries/#time-semantics) in the ksqlDB documentation for more information.

```
CREATE STREAM TEMPERATURE_READINGS_EVENTTIME
    WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='deviceEvents',
          VALUE_FORMAT='avro',
          TIMESTAMP='eventTime');
```
